# Algorithms

1. *Sorting* - Quicksort, Mergesort, Heapsort
2. *Search* - BST, Red-Black BST, **Hash Table**
3. *Graphs* - BFS, DFS, Prim's Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm, Dijstra's Algorithm
4. *Strings* - Radix Sort, Tries, KMP, Regex, Data Compression
5. *Advanced* - B-Tree, Suffix Array, Maxflow

###### Common Questions
- Binary Search(iteratively, recursively)
- Randomized QuickSort(partition subroutine)
- MergeSort
- BFS in graph
- DFS in graph(augment to detect cycles)
- Tree Traversal (Pre, inorder, Past)
- Topological Sort (Tarjan's Algorithm)
- Dijstra's Algorithm (without decrease-key)
- Longest Common Subsequece (using dynamic programming with matrices)
- Knapsack Problem (DP)
- Amortized vs. Average, Worse Case
- High Level Assembly
- BFS, DFS through a matrix
- HeapSort (but don't bother coding it, O(1) but slow to cache efficiency)
- Quick Select and median-of-medians
- Bit Manipulations
- Signed Integer
- Cache, Cache inefficiencies, Cache Miss
- Reading from register: lightning-fast, various cache: pretty fast, memory: slow, hard disk: abysmally slow
- Implement a LRU Cache, write and worst case O(1) time (Common interview problem)
- DNS Lookup, request-response cycle, HTTP Verbs
- How cookies work
- Standard ways to speed up a slow website (adding database indices to optimize common queries, better caching, loading front-end assets from a CDN, cleaning zombie listeners, pretty rabbit holey)
